This week was pretty challenging. I took Coding I but I feel as though I lost some of the things I learned. I had a hard time getting my if/else if statements to work and I was getting error messages from GitHub about my content not syncing. I tried this assignment at multiple locations using different browsers and wifi connects but it was still so slow. After pushing to origin it would take up to 10 minutes to load or sometimes wouldn't load at all. I just had to be patient and play the waiting game and any code related issues I came across I looked at www.w3schools.com for help. I am feeling happy that I successfully completed the assignment even though I ran into a lot of roadblocks.
