        <p>For my homework assignment, I created a virtual "ViewMaster" viewer that displayed 
            images related to social justice. I searched for images that represented social 
            justice issues and included their title, description, author, and date taken. Each 
            time you press a button, a new image with its information appears. To achieve this, 
            I created a class and multiple objects from it, which were stored in an array. It 
            was a challenging task, but it helped me improve my programming skills while exploring 
            important social justice topics.</p>
