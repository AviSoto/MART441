For my assignment, I structured my content using divs in order to make the site responsive. I added a breakpoint that would change the column width as the screen size shrunk as well as a breakpoint for the image so that it would change to a smaller sized image when the screen size shrunk. I chose to match the colors of the site to the colors of my sweater in my profile picture. 

I found that while doing this assignment, I am not remembering as much as I had hoped from my last coding class, Coding I. I anticipated this assignment taking me maybe two hours to complete but I was mistaken. I believe I need to go back into the content and practice as this assignment took me well over six hours to complete. I also missed the example site until after my project was done. Overall I am feeling very disappointed in myself and my skills.
