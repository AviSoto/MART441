This assignment went well for me until I had to get objects moving. I also got a bit confused with the JSON (it wasn't linking since I misspelled obstacles) but after working on this for a while and watching a few tutorials of other similar projects I was finally able to work through it. I wish I could have done a little more such as make the snake longer when it eats an apple but I am proud of the work I put into this project.
